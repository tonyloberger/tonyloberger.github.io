Me and my friend left super early in the morning to get these shots as the sun was rising and while the snow was still stuck to the trees and everything around it";

It gave the vast area of land around Holy Hill that was covered in snow and it was truly beautiful. This film was one of my favorite to ever make and I am glad that I did and I had a ton of fun in doing so.";
